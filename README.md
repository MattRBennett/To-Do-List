# To-Do-List
To Do List that will help you plan your day

**Background:**

This was a codealong task that was presented to me during my web developer bootcamp. This was one of my first few projects where I used Javascript. My lecturer told me what he wanted me to program and showed me what the end result would look like. The original design my lecturer gave me was simple, there was no ui involved. The original contained a blank page with a few instructions of what to enter to use the to-do-list and the user was constantly prompted with what they would like to do. The end result was the original project that I was told to create in Javascript but I added extra HTML/CSS and I modified my original code to link the Javascript to the rest.

**How The App Works:**

This apps works by giving a user a to do list to help them plan there day. The user is given three buttons:

- **Add Item** - A prompt will appear asking the user what they would like to add to the list. If nothing is added a message will appear alerting the user that nothing was added.
- **Remove Item** - A prompt will appear asking the user to type in the number of the item that they would like to remove. If they enter a number that was not on the list or something that is not a number, the user will be alerted that they have entered an incorrect input.
- **New List** - This button will give the user a fresh to do list.
